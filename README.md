# Salesforce Dev Org

## Prerequisites
- Download SF CLI: `npm install @salesforce/cli --global`
    - [More information on installation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm#sfdx_setup_install_cli_macos)
    - [Moving from SFDX CLI to SF CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_move_to_sf_v2.htm)
- [VS Code Salesforce Extension Pack](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode)
- [Java Setup for VS Code](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/vscode-desktop/java-setup)
    - [Java JDK Download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-mac)
 
## Create scratch org
Scratch Orgs are temporary Salesforce environments that are used for development. They are spun up based on a configuration file and contain no metadata upon creation.
- Authenticate Salesforce environment (devhub): `sf org login web -a [alias] -d -r [url]`
- Create a Scratch Org:
    - `make create_scratch NAME=[alias]` OR `sf org create scratch -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a [alias] -d -w 30`
- Open default org:
    - `sf org open`
- Push local metadata to org:
    - `make push` OR `sf project deploy start`
    - Ideally, you'll do this during setup to get all metadata from sfdc repo into the scratch org

## Validate and Deploy
- Implements workflows from [k-capehart/sfdc-github-actions](https://github.com/k-capehart/sfdc-github-actions)
- .github/workflows/main.yml validates the package when a PR is opened
- .github/workflows/release.yml deploys the package when a Release is published
- Salesforce authorization URL is stored in Github Repository Secret
    - sfdx auth url is generated by running following command while authenticated:
        - `sf org display --verbose`
    - authorization is completed by piping the sfdx url into the command:
        - `sf org login -sfdx-url --sfdx-url-stdin`

## Trigger Framework
- Implements trigger framework from [k-capehart/sfdc-trigger-framework](https://github.com/k-capehart/sfdc-trigger-framework)
    - forked from [kevinohara80/sfdc-trigger-framework](https://github.com/kevinohara80/sfdc-trigger-framework)
- Modified to include additional virtual methods
    - `isDisabled()`: If true, skips trigger methods. Implemented through Custom Settings for easy toggling org wide.
    - `applyDefaults()`: Executes before beforeInsert().
    - `validate()`: Executes before afterInsert() and afterUpdate().
